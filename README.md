# C3-DGIST-DOA_estimation
The direction of arrival (DOA) of RF signal estimation program for detecting malicious jamming system

This program shows the phase difference of the received signal between two antennas.

1) Measured data: this file is the measured two-channel radio frequency data. (It is measured with 2 antenna.) 

2) RFScanner_program: EXE file for DOA estimation. This program is designed based on MATLAB. To run this file, MATLAB must be installed.
                      By using this program, you can analyze the measured data. 

3) DOA estimation source code: this file shows the source code of the RF scanner_program file.
